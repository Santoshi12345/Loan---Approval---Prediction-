# Loan Approval Prediction using Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier).

The model is trained on applicant data such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant features.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following features:
- Gender
- Married
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area
- Loan_Status (Target Variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Algorithm

## Machine Learning Model
Random Forest Classifier was used because:
- It handles both categorical and numerical data well
- It reduces overfitting
- It provides high accuracy

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the Python file:
   python loan_prediction.py

## Model Performance
The model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report

## Future Improvements
- Increase dataset size
- Add Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web application
