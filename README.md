# Loan Approval Prediction using Artificial Intelligence
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected 
using a Decision Tree Machine Learning model.
## Files Included
- loan_prediction.py (Main ML model code)
- loan_dataset.csv (Sample dataset)
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
## How It Works
1. Load the dataset
2. Convert categorical values into numerical format
3. Split dataset into training and testing data
4. Train Random Forest model
5. Predict loan approval status
6. Calculate model accuracy
